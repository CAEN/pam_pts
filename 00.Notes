As of the commits made this moring, this source tree successfully builds
pam_pts on RHEL6. It has not yet been tested.

The build notes file 'BUILD-NOTES-pam_pts.txt' is mostly a diff of some
earlier versions and isn't particularly useful. Once I've confirmed and
committed a working version of pam_pts, I'll put a CVS tag on it and move
the old build notes to the attic.
